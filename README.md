# ClippingWindow
Development of a clipping application using Java Swing.

A random pattern of nested triangles is drawn on the screen. You are able to "shut the lights off" and then can walk throughout the screen using directional keys in order to view what's "behind" the shadow.

This simple program implements the algorithm of clipping lines.
